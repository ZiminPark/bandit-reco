# Modern Recommendation for Advanced Practitioners - RecSys Summer School 2019
Course material for our RecSys Summer School 2019 course: Modern Recommendation for Advanced Practitioners.

## What do you need to run the notebook ?
All of the notebooks are designed to run directly on Google Collab, the only extra dependency we install at the start of each noteboook is [RecoGym](https://github.com/criteo-research/reco-gym).

If you don't want to run on Google Collab, you can just checkout the repo and install the requirements specified in `requirements.txt`.

All the notebook were tested with Python 3.6, so please use that version.
