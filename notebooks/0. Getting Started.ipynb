    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will code a simple recommendation agent that suggests an item in proportion to how many times it has been viewed.  We hope to inspire you to create your agents and test them against our baseline models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the most out of RecoGym, we suggest you have some experience coding in Python, some background knowledge in recommender systems, and familiarity with the reinforcement learning setup.  Also, be sure to check out the python-based requirements in the README if something below errors."

Hence, we introduce the domain-agnostic terms _Organic_ and _Bandit_ sessions.  An _Organic_ session is an observation of items the user interacts with.  For example, it could be views of products on an e-commerce website, listens to songs while streaming music, or readings of articles on an online newspaper.  A _Bandit_ session is one where we have an opportunity to recommend the user an item and observe their behavior.  We receive a reward if they click.\n",

We quickly realized that we couldn't just blindly apply RL algorithms in a production system out of the box. The learning period would be too costly. Instead, we need to leverage the vast amounts of offline training examples we already to make the algorithm perform as good as the current system before releasing it into the online production environment.\n",
